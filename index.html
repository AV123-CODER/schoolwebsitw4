<p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’
  ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. 
  At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, 
  At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision
   to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation,
    I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten
     this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is 
     most important to achieve success.</p>

  The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.
   Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make
    the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the 
    school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box 
    and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
     Here again, diversity is the key.</p> </li>

  <h4>Implemented online Attendance Management System</h4>

  <p classe list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
     Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with 
    supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and 
    costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data. <br>
  2. Economics
  Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, 
  buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large 
  organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems. <br>
  3. Productivity / Efficiency
  Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair.
   It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. 
   Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically
    importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources 
    which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management, 
    Flexibility, Integration / Configuration, Real-time tracking, Security, and Compliance
